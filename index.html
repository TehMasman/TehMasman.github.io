	<center><h1>Moo Creek Cottage</h1></center>
	<center><h3 style="padding-left:40px; padding-right:40px;">Moo Creek is a fully equipped holiday home in the heart of the Daintree Rainforest.
			It is within walking distance to Cow Bay Beach and only a short drive to restaurants, boardwalks and other
			sights of the Daintree. With one king bed, double futon and single mattress
			Moo Creek is suitable both for couples and families seeking to get away from it all and relax. With a large open
			living area and covered decking overlooking a private creek and surrounded by rainforest it is a truly tranquil space.</h3></center>

			<h2>The Space</h2>
			<center><p>Moo Creek is entirely reliant on solar power and rainwater so we ask that guests are mindful of
			power and water usage during their stay. We also have a generator as a back up for power. While it doesn't need to be used
			very often you should note that as the property is in a rainforest we do experience periods of cloud and rain and therefore
			at times this will necessitate the running of the generator for power. There is no mobile reception or wifi available on the
			property which adds to the feeling of being able to totally switch off from it all. There is mobile reception available just a
			few minutes drive up the road however if needed. We provide books, movies and games for guests as well as all products including
			shampoo etc. We would also recommend that guests shop for groceries prior to heading into the Daintree (There is a Woolworths
			in Mossman) as there are very limited options for groceries once you have crossed over the river.</p></center>
